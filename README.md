## 42School

42's priority is P2P so I started a open source project for me and my colleagues.
This project contains basic tools that allow us to work faster and more efficiently.
This code will prevent wasting time on rewriting the same function several times
and allow us to share ideas at the same time.
Less time on the generic code and more time on our school project.

## Why I wanted to do this

	Give me six hours to chop down a tree and
	I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.
